 * (Composition as an Alternative to Inheritance) Many programs written with inheritance

 * of the CommissionEmployeeâ€“BasePlusCommissionEmployee hierarchy to use composition
 * rather than inheritance. After you do this, assess the relative merits of the two approaches for 
 * designing classes CommissionEmployee and BasePlusCommissionEmployee, as well as for object-oriented 
 * programs in general. Which approach is more natural? Why?
